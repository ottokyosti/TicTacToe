# TicTacToe
This is my TicTacToe application as a project work for Introduction to programming course.

##To compile and run
`cd tictactoe/src`
`javac game/TicTacToe.java`
`java game/TicTacToe`

##User guide
When the user boots up the application, it will ask a number for the size of the gameboard from the user.
Only one number will be asked because the gameboard will be a rectangle. The size is fully dynamic meaning
user can put any number he/she wants on it (please note that from certain point onwards the size of the 
gameboard will affect the markers inside the application). After the size has been put in, the application 
will ask for how many markers must be next to each other for the win. This number can be anything from 0 to 
the size of the gameboard. The user can put as the size and the winning count almost anything, but
**the game is best played using the size of 3 and the winning count of 3!** After that the game will initialize 
and a window will appear. From there on the user plays a normal TicTacToe-game. When either computer or player 
has won or the game has ended in a tie, a message box will appear and display the result of the game. Pressing the 
"ok" button will close the window and the program. The user can also press the window close button (X) on the 
top right of the window to close the program.
